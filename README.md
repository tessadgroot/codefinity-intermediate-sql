# SQL intermediate course – Codefinity

This repository contains all coding challenges I complete while following the course intermediate SQL on Codefinity.  

## 🧠 What I've Learned
- Using **DDL** and **DML** commands  
- Creating, updating, and deleting tables and records  
- Working with **JOIN** operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)  
- Filtering and combining data from multiple tables  
- Writing clean, structured SQL queries

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each chapter is stored in its own file or folder, grouped by topic or lesson.  

## 🎯 Goal
This repository shows my growth in coding during the course.
